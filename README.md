# Elevation-Map-Analysis
n this assignment, I am analysing the elevation of a section of the Earth's surface. I will represent the section of Earth as a square matrix of numerical values. A square matrix has equal dimensions: the number of rows is the same as the number of columns. Each value in the matrix corresponds to the elevation of the Earth at that particular location. For example, an area the size of 1 square kilometre of Earth could be encoded as a 1000x1000 matrix. Each cell of the matrix contains the elevation of a single square meter. Here, the value at cell [500, 500] of the matrix, would be the elevation at approximately the middle of the original 1 square kilometre section.  For this assignment, you will implement several functions which will allow someone with such a matrix of values to perform meaningful analysis of the Earth elevation data.
